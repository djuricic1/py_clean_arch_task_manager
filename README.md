# py_clean_arch_task_manager

CleanArchTasks-Py is a demonstration project that showcases the implementation of Clean Architecture principles in a task management application using Python. This project aims to provide a clear and organized codebase that emphasizes modularity, maintainability, and separation of concerns.


## Features

- Create, update, and manage tasks with a focus on architectural best practices.
- Distinct layers and responsibilities.
- Well-structured codebase designed for easy extension and testing.


## Architecture Overview

This project follows the principles of Clean Architecture, which consists of several layers:

- **Core Domain Layer**: Defines the core business logic, entities, and use cases.
- **Use Cases Layer**: Implements use cases by orchestrating interactions between the core domain and external interfaces.
- **Frameworks and Drivers Layer**: Handles external concerns such as APIs, databases, and services.
